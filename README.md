# MyAnimeList-Color-Coding
This is a simple greasemonkey script intended to provided some desired functionality around top movie / top manga lists. It has never been easier to keep track of what anime is on your list.

**Note** 
Images are not mine. I have no intention of using these images for more than personal use and for the userscript itself. Nothing is for sale.
